# Tetris Kotlin

Simple implementation of Tetris in Kotlin as a learning exercise.

Missing Features:

- Level (Increase speed at which game ticks, from 1-15)
- Hi-Score (Persistent)
- Showing next piece
- Starting/Pausing/Resuming the game
- Clearing lines once a line is completed
- Improve codebase readability

Bugs to fix:

- Whenever one presses right, the game area loses focus and the start button takes focus
